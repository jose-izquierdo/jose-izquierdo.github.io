I'm a hybrid between web developer and business professional. 

In the last years, I have been gaining experience in both areas, IT and Banking. 

Now, I'm completely focused on the web development since I have finished a Bootcamp of 400 hours at Ironhack. I'm currently working with different technologies such as Ruby on Rails, Emberjs, Javascript, HTML5/CSS3, and Git. 

Furthermore, and regarding my education, I have earned a Bachelor Degree in International Business Administration (BBA) in USA, and a Master Degree MIBA in Spain.
